# Digital Clock with Python

## Overview

This project is a simple digital clock built using Python and Tkinter. It displays the current time, updating every second, and demonstrates the use of Python for GUI (Graphical User Interface) development.

## Features

- Real-time display of the current time
- Simple and clean interface
- Customizable font, background, and foreground colors

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Installation

Tkinter is included with standard Python installations. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using pip:

```sh
pip install tk
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `digital_clock.py` file.

2. Run the script:

   ```sh
   python digital_clock.py
   ```

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the clock by changing the parameters in the `tk.Label` configuration:

- `font=('calibri', 40, 'bold')`: Change the font type, size, and weight.
